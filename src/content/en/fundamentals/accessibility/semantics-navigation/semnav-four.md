You've seen that the more meaningful your headings and link text semantics are, the more usable your page will be to a screen reader user.

You've also seen that, as a general rule, you shouldn't try to control a screen reader user's experience. Screen reader users will use the information available plus the capabilities of the tool they use &mdash; including its idiosyncracies &mdash; to find their own ways of using the page. 

In the next lesson, we'll take a look at what we can do if HTML doesn't have the exact semantics we need or if, for some reason, the HTML element we would usually use isn't a good fit.
