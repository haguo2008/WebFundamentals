As you've seen in this lesson, there are many interesting facets to accessibility worth considering when building an app.

 - You saw that a well laid-out focus strategy is extremely important but that, without focus styling, that effort goes completely to waste.

 - You also learned that semantic markup is critical to assistive technology users, and by using styling that's keyed off semantic properties you can provide a consistent experience for all users.

 - You found that ensuring that all of your text meets a minimum color contrast ratio is an easy way to improve readability for everyone, particularly users with any kind of vision impairment.

 - And you saw how responsive design benefits all mobile device users, as well as users who employ browser zoom.

Keeping all these points in mind means that your final product will reach more users, that those users will have a better experience using your app, and that they will use it more often, to everyone's benefit &mdash; theirs and yours.
